# Chat Negotiator

A multi-party negotiation system with AI assistance, real-time analysis, and Pareto-optimal proposal generation.

Abstract: 
 Although there has been many discussion about the philosophical and impacts of AI‚Äôs being implemented into a negotiation setting, realistic development to actually apply LLM‚Äôs to evaluate and help users navigate negotiation settings have not been addressed.
In this project, we navigate the task of using the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma and fundamental game theory ideas, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Nash Equilibrium, and the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), to provide goal-oriented and actionable feedback, along with analyzing the overall metrics in a negotiation.

The suggested system stores conversation-based data in the graph database Neo4j to represent the complex relationship between interacting parties in the conversation. The coaching algorithm uses a tic for tat system to build up intentions to cooperate, real-time situation responses, and long-term trust. The algorithm uses a gradio based interface to allow users to access chat history, visual graphs based on negotiations, statistical analyses and direct/intuitive coaching messages. 

After testing, results show that the model showed meaningful attempts at negotiation between parties. This has allowed for consideration of future implication in areas like the simulation economic interactions with material objects, buisness settings where understanding moves between real-time negotiations is key, and even in the use of daily interactions. This paper shows how AI can be used as a strategical negotiation and decision making tool in the future in order to overcome logical traps like the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma, but not necessarily as a replacement for human judgement.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd chat-negotiator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env

   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Building and Running

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Access the UI at http://localhost:7860
```

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Start the API server**
   ```bash
   cd app
   python api_server.py
   ```

2. **Start Ollama (if using local models)**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   # Pull a model: ollama pull qwen3:latest
   ```

3. **Launch the Gradio UI**
   ```bash
   cd app
   python gradio_ui.py
   ```

4. **Access the interface**
   - UI: http://localhost:7860
   - API: http://localhost:8000

## üéØ How to Use the UI

### Basic Usage

1. **Start a Conversation**
   - The UI automatically generates a conversation ID
   - You can customize the ID or leave it auto-generated

2. **Select AI Model**
   - Choose from available Ollama or Gemini models
   - Models are automatically detected and listed

3. **Set Up Negotiation**
   - Enter names for both parties
   - Use the role selector to switch between "You" and "Other Party"

4. **Start Chatting**
   - Type messages in the input field
   - Press Enter or click "Send"
   - The system automatically provides:
     - Coach advice for strategic guidance
     - Bot proposals when simulating the other party

### Advanced Features

#### DoND Sample Loading
- Use the slider to load Deal-or-No-Deal validation samples
- Samples include pre-configured negotiation scenarios
- Item counts are displayed in the Statistics panel

#### Conversation Inspector
- View raw conversation history
- See API-generated statistics
- Monitor conversation dynamics

#### Tools & Exports
- **New Conversation**: Start fresh
- **Export Markdown**: Save conversation as markdown file
- **Update Visualizations**: Generate graphs and statistics

#### Model & API Management
- **Refresh Models**: Update available model list
- **Test Ollama**: Verify Ollama connection
- **Check API Status**: Monitor API health

### Auto-Proposal Feature

When you send a message as "Other Party" (role B), the system automatically:

1. **Estimates Preferences**: Analyzes conversation history to infer both parties' preferences
2. **Generates Pareto-Optimal Proposal**: Uses the `best_offer` function to find optimal allocations
3. **Displays Results**: Shows what each party gets in a clear format

Example output:
```
ü§ñ Bot proposal:
‚Ä¢ You get: item0: 2, item1: 1
‚Ä¢ They get: item0: 1, item1: 1, item2: 1
```

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file

## üêõ Debugging

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors
```bash
# If you get "No module named 'app'"
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/chat-negotiator"
```

#### 2. Ollama Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Start Ollama if needed
ollama serve
```

#### 3. API Connection Issues
```bash
# Check API health

## Gradio UI: Detailed Usage & Features

### Launching the Gradio UI

- **Docker Compose (Recommended):**
  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build
  # Access at http://localhost:7860
  ```
- **Local Development:**
  ```bash
  cd app
  python gradio_ui.py
  # Access at http://localhost:7860
  ```

### Main Features Overview

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conversation ID** | Each negotiation session has a unique ID. Use the auto-generated one or enter your own to resume a previous session. |
| **AI Model Selection** | Choose from available models (Ollama or Gemini). The dropdown lists all detected models, and you can enter a custom model name if needed. |
| **Negotiator Names** | Set the display names for yourself and the other party. These names appear in the chat bubbles. |
| **Role Selector** | Switch between sending messages as "You" or "Other Party". This is important for simulating both sides of a negotiation. |
| **Chat Interface** | Type and send messages. The system will: <ul><li>Show your message in the chat</li><li>Provide AI "Coach" advice after each message</li><li>Auto-generate a bot proposal when you send as "Other Party"</li></ul> |
| **DoND Conversation Visualizer** | (Accordion panel) Load and analyze real Deal-or-No-Deal negotiation samples. Includes: <ul><li>Sample selector</li><li>Item counts and speaker stats</li><li>Coach advice for the sample</li><li>Message timeline and analysis plots</li></ul> |
| **Pareto Coach Effectiveness Simulator** | (Accordion panel) Run simulations to see how the AI coach improves negotiation outcomes compared to various baselines. Results and transcripts are displayed. |
| **Export Conversation** | Export the current conversation as a Markdown file for sharing or record-keeping. |
| **Visualizations** | Generate and view negotiation graphs and statistics. |
| **Model Management** | Refresh the list of available models if you add new ones to Ollama or Gemini. |
| **API/Model Status** | (Hidden in UI, but available in code) Check the health of the API and model connections. |

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Start the UI** and open it in your browser.
2. **Enter names** for both parties.
3. **Select your AI model** (e.g., `ollama:qwen3:4b`).
4. **Chat as yourself** or switch to "Other Party" to simulate both sides.
5. **Review coach advice** and bot proposals as you negotiate.
6. **Use the DoND Visualizer** to load and analyze real negotiation samples.
7. **Run the Pareto Coach Simulator** to see how the AI coach impacts outcomes.
8. **Export your conversation** when done.

### Advanced Features

- **Auto-Proposal:** When you send a message as "Other Party", the system estimates preferences and generates a Pareto-optimal proposal using the negotiation history.
- **Conversation Inspector:** (Removed from UI, but code supports it) Lets you view raw conversation data and API-generated stats.
- **Debug/Status Panels:** (Hidden) For advanced troubleshooting.

- The UI is designed for both real negotiations and simulation/testing.
- You can refresh the model list if you add new models to Ollama or Gemini while the UI is running.
- Exporting conversations is useful for sharing negotiation transcripts or for research.
